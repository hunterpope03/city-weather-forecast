## Description
This application is my second personal showcase project. Integrating Open Weather Map's API services, this weather app allows a user to enter a location. Upon choosing a valid location, current and forecasted weather data is displayed in the form of widgets from Open Weather Map. Additionally, a complex mapping option is featured, allowing for five different weather layers and scalable zoom options. All of this was created with the Open Weather Map API free plan. 

## Directory Structure
* **_index.html_** - Utilizes a dynamic layout for all of the elements in the application.
